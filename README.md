# 🧠 AbhirajGPT – ChatGPT-style Developer Portfolio

AbhirajGPT is my **AI-style interactive portfolio**, designed to look and feel like ChatGPT — but instead of using an actual LLM, it responds with curated content about me: my projects, skills, resume, and more.

It's powered by **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and a touch of creative flair.
